# Genres-of-kids-movies

At the moment I get to experience many little kids growing up – and consuming media – around me. The shows that they watch, may it be Peppa Pig or Firefighter Sam, gave me the impression, that the different emptions displayed in the new generation of kinds movies fall kind of flat. And when my niece refused to watch "Finding Nemo" with me, because she got to scared, I asked myself: Are kids movies just endorphine maschines nowadays?

To anser this question I analysed the genres of the kids movies of the last several years. I scraped all movies and shows tagged under kids movies on the IMDb website and looked at the additionally named genres of those movies. Data cleaning had to be done as well.

For the results, look into my jupiter notebook!
